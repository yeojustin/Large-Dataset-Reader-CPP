Welcome to the "Customized Reader For Multiple Large Datasets" project, a Data Structure & Abstractions project associated with Murdoch University. ðŸ“š

## Project Overview

In this project, I designed and implemented a non-GUI based C++ program to efficiently manage and manipulate diverse data elements using an AVL-tree-map-based data structure. The goal was to provide a robust solution for handling multiple large datasets.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Data Management**: Utilized a map data structure to facilitate seamless access to multiple AVL-trees, enhancing data management efficiency.

- **Client-Specific Interaction**: Introduced a specialized wrapper class meticulously tailored for client-specific interactions with the data structure, enhancing code clarity and long-term maintainability.

- **Scalability**: Tackled significant technical challenges, enabling the processing of extensive datasets with over 500,000 entries or more than 5 million individual data points.

- **Real-World Application**: Demonstrated program robustness and scalability in real-world data handling scenarios, showcasing strong computational thinking skills.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Compile and run the C++ program to see it in action.
4. Explore the code to understand the implementation details.

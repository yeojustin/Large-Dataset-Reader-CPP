# Customized Reader For Multiple Large Datasets

![CPP Logo Image](https://i.imgur.com/VJmeyAU.jpeg)

## Overview

I designed and implemented a backend C++ program to efficiently manage and manipulate diverse data elements using an AVL-tree-map-based data structure. The goal was to provide a robust solution for handling multiple large datasets.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Data Management**: Utilized a map data structure to facilitate seamless access to multiple AVL-trees, enhancing data management efficiency.

- **Client-Specific Interaction**: Introduced a specialized wrapper class meticulously tailored for client-specific interactions with the data structure, enhancing code clarity and long-term maintainability.

- **Scalability**: Tackled significant technical challenges, enabling the processing of extensive datasets with over 500,000 entries or more than 5 million individual data points.

- **Real-World Application**: Demonstrated program robustness and scalability in real-world data handling scenarios, showcasing strong computational thinking skills.
